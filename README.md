A simple push notification tool for iOS (HTTP/2)

This tool uses APNS's HTTP/2 setup to send push notifications thereby making it easier and effecient to send push notifications.

This tool supports ability to add custom headers like "apns-collapse-id", "apns-expiration", etc.

For all headers supported by APNS, please refer the link below:

Rest is straightforward. Play around with the app to send push notes.

Feel free to reach out to me for any queries, suggesstions, bugs, improvements.
